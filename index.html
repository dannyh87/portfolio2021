            <h2>Aspiring Developer eager to unleash unfettered enthusiasm to learn and grow. </h2>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring Developer eager to unleash my enthusiasm to learn and grow.
Through my independent learning and the development opportunities of the Generation Bootcamp, I have explored HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js
I do not pretend to be an expert in these areas, however my rapid development throughout my time learning, gives me confidence I can be nurtured to bring real value to a business.

            <div class="right">
                <p>
                    After a successful 15 year career in Sport, I have embarked on a new challenge to become a Junior Web Developer. I am looking for the opportunity to join a business, where I can utilise my new skills
                    and learn from experienced colleagues. As a mature learner I am committed to learning the skills required to become proficient in the area of Web Development. My primary reason for the change or direction
                    is to challenge myself, seek new opportunities and develop as a person. I bring a wealth of experience including Project, Budget and Line Management, and strategy through being involved at a Senior Leadership Team Level.
                    Previous roles have been customer facing, and involved influencing and presenting to both large and intimate audiences, in sometimes challenging circumstances. Through being involved at a Senior Level, I fully understand 
                    the skills required to work independently and as part of a team, and to seek solutions to problems. I consider myself to be an innovative person, who can work off my own initiaive or add value to a wider team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been placed into leadership positions in my personal and professional life, this includes being the Vice-Chairman of a 'not for profit' organisation which seeks to support the local community. Through my role I have 
                    sought to introduce new technological solutions, train staff, increase revenue and profit, all throughout the challenging COVID-19 period. This provides me the opportunity to develop as a person and in business, and to give
                    back to a community which has given me so much.
